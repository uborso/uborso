# 👋 Welcome to @uborso's GitHub Profile!

## 🌟 About Me:
I'm Umberto Borso, a Master's student in **Quantum Engineering** at **ETH Zürich**, with a strong academic background in **Machine Learning** and **Physics**. My research focuses on applying **generative models** and **reinforcement learning** to solve complex decision-making problems in high-dimensional spaces, such as molecular design and dynamic systems.

## 💡 Research Interests:
- **Generative Models** (e.g., Discrete Diffusion Models) for decision-making in large action spaces.
- **Reinforcement Learning** methods, including **Convex and Submodular RL**, for optimizing exploration and exploitation in constrained environments.
- **Probabilistic Artificial Intelligence**, covering areas like **Gaussian Processes**, **Bayesian Neural Networks**, and **Bayesian Optimization**.

## 📚 Current Projects:
- **Master's Thesis at UCL Centre for Artificial Intelligence**: Exploring how generative models, particularly discrete diffusion models, can improve decision-making in large, complex action spaces.
- **Research on Transition Constrained Active Learning**: Applying Reinforcement Learning techniques to optimize information gain in constrained environments, with a focus on molecular space exploration.

## 🤝 Collaboration:
- Interested in collaborating on **Reinforcement Learning** projects.
- Open to contributing to **open-source** projects.
